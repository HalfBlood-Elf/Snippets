this answer solved my problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1139762/ignore-files-that-have-already-been-committed-to-a-git-repository

First of all, commit all pending changes.
Then run this command:
git rm -r --cached .
This removes everything from the index, then just run:
git add .
Commit it:
git commit -m ".gitignore is now working"
PLEASE BE CAREFUL, WHEN YOU PUSH THIS TO A REPOSITORY AND PULL FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE INTO A STATE WHERE THOSE FILES ARE STILL TRACKED, THE FILES WILL BE DELETED


git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m ".gitignore is now working"
